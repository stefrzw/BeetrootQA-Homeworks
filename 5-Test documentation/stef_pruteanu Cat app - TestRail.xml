		<description>EP &amp; BVA explained in Google Docs
________________________________________________________________________

# For  any JPG and PNG image types, with the aspect ratio of 1:1:
&amp;gt; The system accepts a width size within 320 min. and 1080 max. pixels.
&amp;gt; The system accepts a height between 320 min. and 1080 max pixels.
________________________________________________________________________

**Assuming the system has the code for 1:1 ratio implemented and tested, here are the cases for each BV for file sizes**

I derived 3 tests for the sake of system&apos;s response to alert users of their image size more clearly</description>
